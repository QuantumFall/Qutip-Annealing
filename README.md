# Qutip-Annealing


Quantum annealing done using QuTip. Main project is on investigating how variations in QAOA (warm starts, different mixing Hamiltonians, etc)
reflect within the annealing schedule. 

The code here performs a simple task but is a bit more complicated than it has to be as the project is still unfinished.
