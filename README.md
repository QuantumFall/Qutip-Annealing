# Qutip-Annealing


Quantum annealing done using QuTip. The code here performs a simple task but is slightly more complicated than it should as it is used in
the later part of a project that is still ongoing.

The main project is on investigating how variations in QAOA (warm starts, different mixing Hamiltonians, etc)
reflect within the annealing schedule.
